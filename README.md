# UK-Train-Rides: 
Railway ticket records with Python and Pandas, covering purchase type, payment, journey times, delays, and refunds. Explores pricing patterns, customer behavior, and delay reasons. Includes visualizations and stats for EDA, time series insights, and improving rail service efficiency.

🚆 UK Railway Ticket Analysis: 

➡️ This project analyzes real-world ticketing data from the UK Railway system. The dataset contains details about ticket purchases, journey information, delays, and more.

📁 Dataset The data used in this project is from link(Internal/Provided Dataset) and it includes:
Ticket prices
Departure and arrival stations
Purchase types and payment methods
Journey statuses and delay reasons

🎯 Project Objectives
Average Ticket Price by Departure Station – Identify and rank stations based on average ticket prices.
Outlier Detection – Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify unusually priced tickets.
Delay Analysis – Calculate the percentage of delayed journeys by reason.
Ticket Class Comparison – Compare average ticket prices by class (e.g., Standard vs. First).
Payment Method Distribution – Analyze how passengers pay for tickets.

🧼 Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the following steps were taken:
Handled missing values and cleaned inconsistent entries
Converted date and time formats
Standardized categorical variables
Removed duplicates

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To uncover patterns and trends, the following techniques were used:
Grouping and ranking
Boxplots for outlier detection
Pie and bar charts for categorical insights
Time and delay comparisons

🛠️ Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

🌍 Why This Project Matters
Understanding ticket pricing, delays, and user behavior can help transportation authorities and passengers:
Improve pricing strategies
Enhance customer satisfaction
Reduce delays and improve planning
Optimize ticketing systems and marketing
